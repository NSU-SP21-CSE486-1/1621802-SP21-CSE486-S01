# Project Name: NSU CPC App


# Introduction
Career placement allows students to gain skills specific to their subject and employability skills required for real-life work. It also increases their knowledge of the sector and will enable them to make better-informed decisions about future career choices. The placement provides the opportunity to be involved in team base working, which provides a welcome contrast to a more individual-centric approach to academic study. It will be beneficial to build self-management and problem-solving skills, which will help to work collaboratively.

A clear beneficial output for students from undertaking a placement is the ability to effectively evidence their CV experiences, provide documented contextual proof for their skills, and coupled with a reference. 

NSU Career and Placement App allow us to manage and collaborate with industries and student in on place. It gives the student more freedom to build themselves for real-world experiences.

# Background
Finding a job is a hassle for fresh graduates. Many of us donâ€™t know how to apply for a job that will be guaranteed. We face many problems during writing a CV, Job Interview, and many more. On the other hand, for those who manage those, it becomes painful to them because of unorganized work. To solve the problem we introduce the NSU CPC App, where students can easily apply for new jobs or internships. And CPC members can also organize their work with this app.
