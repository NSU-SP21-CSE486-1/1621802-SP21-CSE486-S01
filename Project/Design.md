# UI & UX Design Documentation

Based on user flows, I can start creating a feature map to visualize the information architecture of our product.

I divided my Design workflow in 8 category. Those categories are

- User flow
- Sitemap
- Foundations
- UI elements
- Components
- Wireframes
- High fidelity design
- Prototype



All work can be found on the following link ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡
